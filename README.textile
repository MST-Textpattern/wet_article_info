*wet_article_info* is a very simple plugin for "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com/that displays some extra information on the *article > write* page.

When editing an existing article, you'll see something like this just below the Last Modified details:

bq. 705 words (680 + 25) | comments

The first item is a word count: the total words, followed by individual counts for the body and excerpt.

@comments@ will display a short summary of article comments, if any, with edit links for each.

The information is _not_ real time; it is updated when you save an article or open it for editing.
